# Place your GLTF head model here
# Expected structure:
# models/head/scene.gltf
# models/head/textures/
#
# The model should ideally have:
# - A bone named "head" or "Head" for head rotation
# - A bone named "neck" or "Neck" (optional)
# - Meshes named "eye_left" and "eye_right" for eye tracking (optional)
#
# If no model is found, a placeholder head will be created automatically.
#
# Recommended free head models:
# - Sketchfab (search for "head rigged")
# - Mixamo (character heads)
# - ReadyPlayerMe avatars
